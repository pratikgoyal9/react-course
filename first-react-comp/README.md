# Notes

## File Extensions
1. `.JSX`
    - Stands for JavaScript XML
    - Combines JavaScript with HTML-like tags
    - Makes it easier to design UI components

## Class vs Functional Components

### Class Components
    - Stateful: Can manage state
    - Lifecycle: Access to lifecycle methods
    - Verbose: More boilerplate code
    - Not preferred anymore

### Functional Components
    - Initially stateless
      - Cannot store properties and methods like classes in Java
    - Can use Hooks for state and effects
    - Simpler and more concise
    - More popular

## What is JSX?
1. **Definition**: JSX determines how the UI will look wherever the component is used
1. **Not  HTML**: Thought it represents HTML, you're actually writing JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML
1. **Conversion**: JSX gets converted to regular JavaScript
1. **`Babeljs.io/repl`** is a tool that allows you to see how JSC is transformed into JavaScript
